# Motion detection using Passive-Infrared-PIR-Sensor
•	This is a project that represents the interfacing between a Passive Infrared Sensor and Arduino Uno R3. 
•	A PIR sensor is used to detect motion and a microcontroller can be used as an interfacing device to control the sensor.
•	A LED is used as an indicator to indicate the motion detected by the PIR sensor. Whenever there is motion in front of the sensor, The LED switches ON. The LED resets and switches OFF after a point and the sensor goes back to detecting any motion.
•	If the sensor is low for more than the given pause, it is assumed that no more motion is going to happen and the sensor automatically resets.
